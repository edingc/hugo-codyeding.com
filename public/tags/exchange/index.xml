      <description>We have lately had a rash of compromised email accounts in our Office 365 Exchange Online infrastructure. It appears a well-crafted phishing email caught at least a small percentage of our 100,000-plus mailboxes.
The outbound SPAM protection in Office 365 and Exchange Online is very robust. Suspected SPAM messages are sent through a high-risk pool of IP addresses, and accounts are limited to 10,000 outbound messages per day before being blocked by the anti-SPAM intelligence.</description>

      <description>We had a request to add permissions for a customer throughout a deeply nested structure in our Exchange Online Public Folders.
These commands will not override or change permissions where they are already set.
Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell $Cred = Get-Credential Connect-MSOLService -Credential $Cred $Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.outlook.com/powershell -Credential $Cred -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection Import-PSSession $Session  Add Permissions and Verify Success In PowerShell, run:
Get-PublicFolder -Identity &amp;quot;\Folder Name&amp;quot; -Recurse | Add-PublicFolderClientPermission -User jsmith -AccessRights Owner  Verify the change was successful:</description>
