      <description>We have lately had a rash of compromised email accounts in our Office 365 Exchange Online infrastructure. It appears a well-crafted phishing email caught at least a small percentage of our 100,000-plus mailboxes.&#xA;The outbound SPAM protection in Office 365 and Exchange Online is very robust. Suspected SPAM messages are sent through a high-risk pool of IP addresses, and accounts are limited to 10,000 outbound messages per day before being blocked by the anti-SPAM intelligence.</description>
