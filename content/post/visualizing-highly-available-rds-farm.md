I stood up my first Microsoft Remote Desktop Services several months ago, with a great deal of help from [TheWolfBlog's](https://thewolfblog.com/2014/02/08/deploying-a-2012-2012r2-remote-desktop-services-farm/) great guide.

One thing I didn't have when I started my work was a good illustration of how the final highly-available infrastructure would look. I've included an image of a sample setup below, and I hope it benefits someone.

In the image below, the firewalls represent load balancers.
